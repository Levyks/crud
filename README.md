## Introduction

<a href="https://orchid.software/" target="blank">Laravel Orchid</a> has provided a unique experience for writing applications, but sometimes a simple CRUD needs to be done when it might seem overkill. Therefore, we have created a new package aimed at developers who want to quickly create a user interface for eloquent models with functions such as create, read, update, and delete.


You can describe the entire process using one file. And when you need more options, it's easy to switch to using the platform.
All fields, filters, and traits are compatible.

## Installation

You can install the package using the –°omposer.
To do this, you need to install a new Composer repository in the `composer.json` file of your Laravel application.

```json
"repositories": [
    {
        "type": "vcs",
        "url": "https://github.com/orchidsoftware/crud.git"
    }
],
```

Next, add personal token to the config section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
"config": {
    "github-oauth": {
        "github.com": "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
    }
},
```

No token? Head to [settings page](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new?scopes=repo&description=Orchid+CRUD) to retrieve a token.

> If you don't want to store the token in your composer file, you can skip this step. When installing, Composer will ask for it on its own and save it to ".composer/auth.json". Or you can specify it yourself by running: `composer config -g github-oauth.github.com XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`
 
Next, add `orchid/crud` to the require section of your `composer.json` file:

```json
"require": {
    "orchid/crud": "*"
},
```

After your `composer.json` file has been updated, run the composer update command in your console terminal:

```bash
composer update
```

## Defining Resources

Resources are stored are stored in the `app/Orchid/Resources` directory of your application.
You may generate a new resource using the `orchid:resource` Artisan command:

```bash
php artisan orchid:resource Post
```

The most basic and fundamental property of a resource is its `model` property. 
This property tells the generator which Eloquent model the resource corresponds to:

```php
use App\Models\Post;

/**
 * The model the resource corresponds to.
 *
 * @var string
 */
public static $model = Post::class;
```

Freshly created resources contain nothing. Don't worry, we'll add more fields to our resource soon.

## Expanding of Model

Many features of the Orchid platform relies on model customization. You can add or remove traits depending on your goals. But we will assume that you have set these for your model:

```php
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Factories\HasFactory;
use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Orchid\Attachment\Attachable;
use Orchid\Filters\Filterable;
use Orchid\Screen\AsSource;

class Post extends Model
{
    use HasFactory, AsSource, Filterable, Attachable;
}
````


## Registering Resources

By default, all resources within the `app/Orchid/Resources` directory will automatically be registered.
You are not required to manually register them.


## Permissions Resources

For each registered resource, a new permission is created. It is necessary to give the right to manage it to the user.
To click on the profile in the left column and go to the system page, and then to the page with users, 
where you can issue them a mandate or assign a role. After that, they will be displayed in the left menu.

## Defining Fields

Each resource contains a `fields` method. This method returns an array of fields, which generally extend the `Orchid\Screen\Field` class. 

To add a field to a resource, we can simply add it to the resource's `fields` method. Typically, fields may be created using their static `make` method. This method accepts several arguments; however, you usually only need to pass the name of the field.


```php
use Orchid\Screen\Fields\Input;

/**
 * Get the fields displayed by the resource.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function fields(): array
{
    return [
        Input::make('title')
            ->title('Title')
            ->placeholder('Enter title here'),
    ];
}
```
In the package to generate CRUD, you can use the fields Orchid platform. Review [all available fields on the documentation site](https://orchid.software/en/docs/field/).


## Defining –°olumns

Each resource contains a `—Åolumns` method. To add a column to a resource, we can simply add it to the resource's `column` method. Typically, columns may be created using their static `make` method. 

```php
use Orchid\Screen\TD;

/**
 * Get the columns displayed by the resource.
 *
 * @return TD[]
 */
public function columns(): array
{
    return [
        TD::set('id'),
        TD::set('title'),
    ];
}
```
The CRUD generation package is entirely based on the table layer. You can [read more about this on the documentation page](https://orchid.software/en/docs/layouts/table/).

## Eager Loading

If you routinely need to access a resource's relationships within your fields, it may be a good idea to add the relationship to the `with` property of your resource. This property instructs Nova to always eager load the listed relationships when retrieving the resource.

For example, if you access a `Post` resource's `user` relationship within the `Post` resource's `subtitle` method, you should add the `user` relationship to the `Post` resource's `with` property:

```php
 /**
 * Get relationships that should be eager loaded when performing an index query.
 *
 * @return array
 */
public function with(): array
{
    return ['user'];
}
```
